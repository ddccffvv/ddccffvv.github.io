Below are the 5 mindsets the authors introduce to use to design your life.
They struck a chord with me, so I put them here to ensure I would read them often.

### Curiosity

* Makes everything new, makes you try things.
* Helps you to be one of those people that "knows how to get lucky".

### Bias to action

* Try things.
* Build your way forward.
* Designers try many things, test often, until they find a solution.

### Reframing

* Taking a step back, helps us get unstuck.
* Makes sure we're working on the right problem.

### Awareness

* Know it's a process, don't have to be perfect every time/all the time.
* Helps you let go of a good but not great solution.
* Life is messy, but sometimes great things come out of the mess (sticky note,...)
* It's a journey, make sure we enjoy ourselves while we're on the way.

### Radical collaboration

* Ask for help.
* Best ideas often come from others.
* When you reach ut to the world, the world reaches right back.
