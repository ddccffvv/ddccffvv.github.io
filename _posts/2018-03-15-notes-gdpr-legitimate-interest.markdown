This article contains notes on the Working Party 29 opinion on the "Notion of legitimate interests of the data controller". 
The full article can be found [here](http://collections.internetmemory.org/haeu/20171122154227/http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp217_en.pdf)

## The concept of interest
Interest vs purpose:
* Purpose: specific reason for processing
* Interest: broader, the benefit the controller derives from processing

Example: interest is employee safety, purpose: implementation of access control

Interest must be pursued by the controller: so it is a real and present interest

## When is an interest legitimate?	
An interest can be considered as legitimate as long as the controller can pursue this interest in a way that is in accordance with data protection and other laws. In other words, a legitimate interest must be ‘acceptable under the law'

So, it needs: 
* Lawful
* Clearly articulated (to be able to conduct balancing test)
* Present a real and present interest



## The interests or rights of data subject
Must be given broad interpretation.
The interest of the data subject does not have to be “legitimate” (unlike controller interest).

## Introducing balancing test
* Interests and rights of subject and legitimate interests controller can be seen on a spectrum, ranging from very important to trivial.
* Minor controller legitimate interest may only override even more trivial interests data subject
* Important legitimate interest may in some cases (subject to safeguards & measures) justify significant impact on rights and interests data subject

## Key factors for balancing test

These factors can be taken into account when conducting a balancing test.

### Assessing the controllers legitimate interest
* Exercising a fundamental right (newspaper publicizing the details of fraudulent actions of a politician)
* Public interest (wider community interest), for example: charity processing data for medical research, company detecting fraud (both for itself and the community)
* Other legitimate interest…
* Also playing a role in establishing legitimacy:
    * Non binding industry guidelines (or authority guidelines)
    * Societal expectations

### Impact on data subjects
#### Assessing impact:
* Both positive as negative impact into account
* Also emotional impact (irritation, fear due to loss of control over data, realising data has been misused,...)
* ‘Impact’ => covers any possible consequences of data processing (not only the ones that actually happened)
* Identify the sources of potential impact
* Take normal risk assessment methodology into account (likelihood & severity)

#### Nature of data
* the more sensitive the information involved, the more consequences there may be for the data subject

#### The way the data is processed
* Processing scale: processing seemingly innocuous data on a large scale might lead to big impact
* The more negative or uncertain impact of processing is, the less it will be considered legitimate

#### Reasonable expectations of data subject
* Is a data subject reasonably expecting the processing (like receiving email with product tips)

#### Status controller vs data subject
* Controller might be dominant (very big company, the only provider,...)
* If data subject is a child => even more so
* Also important: employer ⇔ employee relationship

#### Provisional balance
* Balance after taking into account the above interests and rights
* Might be clear
* Might not be and need countermeasures

#### Additional safeguards
* If provisional balance not clear yes or no, we can introduce safeguards
* Examples:
    * Restriction of data collected
    * Measures to ensure data cannot be used to take decisions on individuals
    * Anonymisation techniques
    * Increased transparency
    * Right to opt out
    * Other measures to empower data subject

## Accountability and transparency
* Is there a legitimate interest? Is the processing needed for the legitimate interest? Do interests and rights data subject override the legitimate interest? => controller accountable for making and documenting exercise
* Using the processed data for something else than advertised is obviously not allowed (or even, only mentioned in the fine print)

## The right to object 
* Even if we made the balancing test, data subject can still object -> need to assess if objection is legitimate and stop processing if so
* Controller can do more: offer unconditional opt out (is a additional safeguard)
