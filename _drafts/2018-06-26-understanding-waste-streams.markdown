This article contains a summary of the "Understanding waste streams" document provided by the  European Parliamentary Research Service.
I only focus on plastics.
The full article can be found [here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-564398-Understanding-waste-streams-FINAL.pdf)


Waste streams are flows of specific waste, from its source to recovery, recycling or disposal.
These streams can be divided into two categories: streams consisting of materials (plastic, metal, wood) and streams consisting of products (old cars, electronics) that need to be disassembled into different materials streams.

When assessing different waste streams, the following aspects are of importance:

1. Source of waste
2. Usage of treated waste
3. Applicable recycling and recovery methods
4. Specific opportunities and challenges
5. Applicable legislation and its implementation

## Waste stream principles:
Two principles apply accross all streams:

1. Waste hierarchy
2. Pollutor pays

### Waste hierarchy

The waste hierarchy sets the priority order amongst the waste treatment methods (from most preferred to least preferred):

1. Prevention
2. Preparing for reuse
3. Recycling
4. (Energy) recovery
5. Disposal


### Polluter pays

The polluter pays principle requires the polluters to bear the cost of preventing, controlling and
cleaning up pollution.
This principle is implemented in the "extended producer responsibility" (EPR) system, which seems to be the preferred method for forcing producers to take responsibility  for collecting or taking back used goods, for sorting them and for their eventual recycling.

## Plastics

### Material related stream

There are many (over 1000) different kinds of plastic. This makes recycling difficult, compared to glass or metal, which often only exist in a few different kinds.
