<div class="post">
<p>When pentesters or ethical hackers have completed their assignment, all they leave behind is the “security assessment report”. For people without a background in security, it can be difficult to understand. As a result, it can be hard to take appropriate measures.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll try to explain the contents of an assessment report in layman’s terms.</p>

<h2 id="before_we_begin">Before we begin</h2>

<p>Security professionals will often try to estimate the <em>likelihood</em> of a certain issue or vulnerability. This is the estimated chance that an attacker will find and abuse a flaw. To make the estimate, the pentester looks at various categories such as: difficulty to attack, ease of access to the flaw (is it protected by other mechanisms),</p>

<p>The ethical hackers that performed the assessments are often external consultants that posess deep technical knowledge but often lack business insight. When they are talking about likelihood, it is always important to place the word <em>technical</em> in front of it.</p>

<h2 id="outline_of_a_typical_report">Outline of a typical report</h2>

<p>A security report often consists of 2 parts: an <em>Executive summary</em> and a <em>Technical report</em>.</p>

<p><em>Executive summary</em>: In this section, the high level summary of the results of the test are outlined. The executive summary is the most important source of information for people that want an overview of the various security related issues uncovered in the assessment.</p>

<p>There should be information about the <em>goal</em> of the assessment, a general estimation about the <em>security level</em> of the tested application or environment, an overview of the most <em>important findings</em> and some general <em>suggestions to remidiate</em> these findings.</p>

<p><em>Technical report</em>: This section of the report is targeted at the more technical people that will have to implement the various suggestions made by the ethical hackers. However, it still contains some important pieces of information for those who know where to look.</p>

<p>The technical report basically contains a list of all discovered issues. Each described issue should at least have a rating (=likelihood), a short description of why it is important (what can attackers do with it), there should be evidence of the finding and there should be a description of the needed steps to reproduce the issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Impact</em>: The ethical hacker tries to guess what the impact would be for the organisation. For example:</li>
</ul>
